                <p>R&B is the most emotionally resonant genre in American music — and it demands a DJ who doesn't just know the hits but understands the depth. DJ DX has spent over 20 years building a catalogue that spans classic Motown and soul, the golden era of 90s R&B (Aaliyah, Usher, Mary J. Blige, Maxwell, D'Angelo), the neo-soul renaissance of the 2000s, and today's boundary-pushing contemporary artists like SZA, H.E.R., Frank Ocean, and Brent Faiyaz.</p>
                <p>R&B works at every level of an event — it provides elegant background music during cocktail hours, emotional peaks during milestone moments, and danceable energy when the floor needs to move. DJ DX has used R&B as the backbone of sets at upscale corporate galas, intimate birthday parties, wedding receptions, and rooftop summer events across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and New Jersey. The genre is a tool; knowing when and how to deploy it is the craft.</p>
                <p>With 3,000+ R&B tracks catalogued across every sub-genre and era, DJ DX brings real depth to R&B bookings — not a surface-level playlist of obvious hits, but a curated journey through the genre that respects its history while connecting it to where it's going. Custom setlists built around your guests, your moment, your vision.</p>
