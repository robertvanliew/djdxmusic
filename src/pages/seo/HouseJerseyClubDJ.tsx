                <p>House music is the heartbeat of New York City's nightlife — and Jersey Club is the tri-state area's own genre invention, a sound born in Newark that has crossed over to global dancefloors. DJ DX has been mixing house music for over 20 years, from the deep soulful house that defined late-night New York to the afro house movement (Black Coffee, Enoo Napa, Themba) that has become the dominant sound for upscale events and boutique clubs.</p>
                <p>Jersey Club is more than a regional novelty — it's a genre with specific technical demands: fast BPMs, complex kick patterns, chopped vocal samples, and a crowd that knows exactly what authentic Jersey Club sounds like. DJ DX brings that authenticity, integrating it with Afrobeats and hip-hop in ways that feel seamless rather than jarring. For events in Newark, Jersey City, and Brooklyn's club scene, Jersey Club is the expectation — DJ DX delivers it with 20+ years of experience behind the decks.</p>
                <p>Whether the event calls for a sophisticated deep house cocktail set or a peak-hour club experience, DJ DX reads the room and adapts. House music is not one sound — it's a spectrum, and knowing where to go on that spectrum at any given moment is the skill that separates a DJ from a playlist.</p>
