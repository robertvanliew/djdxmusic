                <p>Rooftop parties in New York City carry a specific magic — an open-air freedom that unlocks people in ways indoor venues can't, and a summer energy that demands a DJ who knows how to match the moment without overpowering it. DJ DX has performed outdoor and rooftop events across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Hamptons — most recently a rooftop corporate event at <strong>Rockefeller Center</strong> for an international law firm — building a deep understanding of how outdoor acoustics, weather, and the natural social flow of open-air events shape what the music needs to do.</p>
                <p>Sound for rooftop events is a science: open spaces diffuse sound, wind creates challenges, and the balance between keeping the vibe alive and respecting residential surroundings requires experience and the right equipment configuration. DJ DX works with professional audio partners to ensure every rooftop event sounds clean, warm, and powerful at the appropriate level for the space.</p>
                <p>Musically, rooftop sets are a DJ DX specialty. The genre blend for outdoor summer events: Afrobeats and Amapiano as the backbone, layered with contemporary R&amp;B for social hours, house music as the night builds, and Soca or Dancehall if the crowd wants to peak. A sophisticated progression that feels effortless.</p>
