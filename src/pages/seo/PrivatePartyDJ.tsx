                <p>A private party is exactly that — personal. The music isn't supposed to feel like a venue's house playlist. It should feel like the person being celebrated: their tastes, their memories, their energy. DJ DX has spent over two decades learning how to translate a person into a setlist — researching the guest of honor's musical identity and building something that feels singularly theirs.</p>
                <p>From intimate birthday gatherings in Brooklyn lofts to sprawling anniversary galas at New Jersey estates, DJ DX brings the same level of craft to every private event regardless of scale. The pre-event consultation is thorough: DJ DX reviews the guest list age range, the host's musical preferences, any must-plays and never-plays, and the venue dimensions to build a sound plan that serves the space.</p>
                <p>Private parties also demand real-time responsiveness — knowing when to drop the tempo, when to ignite it, and when a surprise song will make twenty people rush the floor. That instinct is the product of 500+ events and a genuine love for DJing as a performing art.</p>
